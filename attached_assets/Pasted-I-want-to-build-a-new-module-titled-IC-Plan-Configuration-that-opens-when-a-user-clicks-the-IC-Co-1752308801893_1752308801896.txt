I want to build a new module titled "IC Plan Configuration" that opens when a user clicks the "IC Configuration" card from the landing page of our existing Incentive Compensation platform.

The overall UI/UX should retain the base design system already implemented in the current tool ‚Äî including:

Navigation bar, header styling, and page layout

Fonts, buttons, colors, margins, shadows, etc.

Follow the same container/card structure used on pages like ‚ÄúUpload Your Dataset for Processing‚Äù

However, this new module will introduce a chatbot-style assistant that interacts with the user to help them design incentive plans through natural conversation. Once the plan is configured, the assistant should display a visual summary with clear justifications for each decision.

üîß Functional Requirements
1. Conversational AI Assistant Panel
Implement a chat-like assistant interface using the tool‚Äôs existing component style

The assistant should:

Accept natural language input from the user (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate a motivating plan for reps who outperform their targets‚Äù)

Ask for missing details:

Payout cap (yes/no)

Budget constraints

Role-specific factors

Ethical prioritization vs. revenue maximization

Store all answers as structured configuration values

2. Configuration Summary (AI Response Preview Panel)
Alongside the chat, show a summary panel that dynamically updates as the conversation progresses

The summary should follow card-based formatting and match existing design system

Each component should include:

Title

AI-generated config

Justification (why it was selected, based on user inputs)

Example:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Component: Plan Type - "Goal Attainment"
Reason: Based on your input to drive overperformance with ethical consideration.
Configuration: 120% accelerators with capped payouts at 150%
3. Pay Curve Generator
Auto-generate a default pay curve (performance % vs payout %)

Allow users to:

Edit via interactive graph (drag to adjust)

Or switch to manual entry

Embed the graph using the existing card layout

4. What-If Simulator
Add a section within the same page:

Upload historical performance data (CSV or from dataset)

Inputs: quotas, thresholds, component weights

Outputs:

Total payout cost

Per-rep incentive

Comparison with previous plan (visually)

Motivation Score (optional metric with tooltip)

Keep layout consistent with existing ‚ÄúSubmit for Analysis‚Äù or ‚ÄúUpload Dataset‚Äù UI

5. Final Actions
Finalize Plan button (use existing button style)

Preview Summary (opens a modal or collapsible section)

On save, store all config and push it to the IC Processing module

Make sure saved plans are accessible via backend integration in IC Processing dropdowns or list

üìê Design Notes
Reuse existing UI framework: use the same top nav, button style, modal, card shadows, fonts, spacing

Split-page layout:

Left Panel: Chatbot (40%)

Right Panel: Configuration summary, pay curve, simulator (60%)

Sticky summary section as conversation grows

Fully responsive (stack sections on mobile)

No need to redesign global navigation or color system ‚Äî match tool's base theme

üîÅ Routing & Integration
Route: /ic-plan-configuration

On Finalize:

Save config to DB

Plan becomes available in IC Processing module for computation
